At this point, the rest of the cube may be totally messed up, but no worry… Just turn the upper face until another corner to turn is at the good spot and apply the formula again until it gets the good orientation… Repeat this until the face is complete.

        <!--en-->Once the face in complete, the rest of the cube (which was scrambled) is automatically solved again. You just need to remember that <b>you must not turn the cube between two applications of the formula</b>, but you should only turn its upper face.
