	<!--en-->Two different tools
      </h2>
      <p>
	<!--en-->Those two tools are perfectly complementary…
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    <!--en-->For each OLL case, <a href="./ollTrainer.html">the OLL Trainer</a> knows the formula to apply in order to place the cube in the configuration to solve. The user tells the tool which configurations he wishes to learn or review, and the tool submits one by one the cases to him. The user has just to apply the provided formula on a real cube, and then solve the OLL step. Please note that the provided formulas are volontarily too long in order not to give any clue concerning the solving formula.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <!--en--><a href="./cubelessTrainer.html">The Cubeless Trainer</a> submits a picture of the configuration to solve to the user. This one has just to enter the solving formula. This tools concerns as well the OLL phase as the PLL phase.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </p>
      <p>
	<!--en-->The first tool helps to train speed and dexterity, while the second one permits to memorize the formulas in a more permanent way. In fact, it seems that memory of the gesture (useful in the first tool) vanishes much more quickly than the knowledge of the text of the formula.
      </p>
      <p>
	<!--en-->The first tool is dedicated to the OLL phase because it is quite difficult to place the cube in a particular OLL configuration. For the PLL step, the training process is much easier because you often just have to perform the solving formula of a given case to a solved cube to place you in the right configuration.
      </p>
      <h2>
	<!--en-->Compatible with mobile devices.
      </h2>
      <p>
	<!--en-->Those tools have been designed to be handy on mobile devices. A waiting line is indeed a perfect place for reviewing OLL/PLL formulas ;-)
      </p>
      <h2>
	<!--en-->SHATARO… or not
      </h2>
      <p>
	<!--en-->The OLL Trainer is not related to shataro in any way. The scrambling formulas are given in classical convention, but it does not prevent the user from having memorised the solutions in shataro language. Concerning the Cubeless Trainer, it is able to understand both shataro and standard notation.
